# monokaiForProcessing
Monokai Dark theme for Processing for Mac and Windows. Easier on the eyes, with the Monokai/Sublime classic colours.

##Installation

###Mac

1. Go to Documents > Processing and rename preferences.txt to preferencesOld.txt (this is just so you don't lose them if something goes wrong)
2. Copy preferences.txt from this repo into that folder
3. Go to Applications, find Processing.app, right click and choose 'Show Package Contents'
4. Go to Contents > Java > lib and rename theme.txt to themeOld.txt
5. Copy in theme.txt from this repo
6. Open Processing et voila! (If Processing was already running you will need to close it and open it again to see changes)
